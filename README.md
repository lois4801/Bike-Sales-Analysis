# Bike Store Performance Analysis
- A store who sells bikes in North America, Europe, and Pacific  needed some help in analysing the raw data they have . The data is comprised of 1026 rows, and 13 attributes.

## The owner wanted to acquire the answers for the following questions.
- How much per region are my buyers for male and female? Where should I focus, and who are my leads?

- Which profession has the highest and lowest average income for my buyers and non buyers?
Who are my hot leads and cold leads?

- What is the average income of married and single customers?
  Should I target more married couples or single couples in our google ads or in marketing campaign?
  
- For our marketing campaign and ads campaign who should I target in facebook, twitter and tiktok ?
  Define the buyers quantity per age group and per region.

- I am interested to know the commute distance trendline of my buyers and non buyers.
  Who buys more? Is it those who travels more and travels less?
